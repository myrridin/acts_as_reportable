module Ruport

  # === Overview
  # 
  # This module is designed to allow an ActiveRecord model to be converted to
  # Ruport's data structures.  If ActiveRecord is available when Ruport is
  # loaded, this module will be automatically mixed into ActiveRecord::Base.
  #
  # Add the acts_as_reportable call to the model class that you want to
  # integrate with Ruport:
  #
  #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     acts_as_reportable
  #     belongs_to :author
  #   end
  #
  # Then you can use the <tt>report_table</tt> method to get data from the
  # model using ActiveRecord.
  #
  #   Book.report_table(:all, :include => :author)
  #
  module Reportable

    def self.included(base) #:nodoc:
      base.extend ClassMethods  
    end

    # === Overview
    # 
    # This module contains class methods that will automatically be available
    # to ActiveRecord models.
    #
    module ClassMethods 

      # In the ActiveRecord model you wish to integrate with Ruport, add the 
      # following line just below the class definition:
      #
      #   acts_as_reportable
      #
      # Available options:
      #
      # <b><tt>:only</tt></b>::     an attribute name or array of attribute
      #                             names to include in the results, other
      #                             attributes will be excuded.
      # <b><tt>:except</tt></b>::   an attribute name or array of attribute
      #                             names to exclude from the results.
      # <b><tt>:methods</tt></b>::  a method name or array of method names
      #                             whose result(s) will be included in the
      #                             table.
      # <b><tt>:include</tt></b>::  an associated model or array of associated
      #                             models to include in the results.
      #
      # Example:
      # 
      #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     acts_as_reportable, :only => 'title', :include => :author
      #   end
      #

        include Ruport::Reportable::InstanceMethods
        extend Ruport::Reportable::SingletonMethods
      end
    end

    # === Overview
    # 
    # This module contains methods that will be made available as singleton
    # class methods to any ActiveRecord model that calls
    # <tt>acts_as_reportable</tt>.
    #
    module SingletonMethods

      # Creates a Ruport::Data::Table from an ActiveRecord find. Takes 
      # parameters just like a regular find.
      #
      # Additional options include:
      #
      # <b><tt>:only</tt></b>::     An attribute name or array of attribute
      #                             names to include in the results, other
      #                             attributes will be excuded.
      # <b><tt>:except</tt></b>::   An attribute name or array of attribute
      #                             names to exclude from the results.
      # <b><tt>:methods</tt></b>::  A method name or array of method names
      #                             whose result(s) will be included in the
      #                             table.
      # <b><tt>:include</tt></b>::  An associated model or array of associated
      #                             models to include in the results.
      # <b><tt>:filters</tt></b>::  A proc or array of procs that set up
      #                             conditions to filter the data being added
      #                             to the table.
      # <b><tt>:transforms</tt></b>::  A proc or array of procs that perform
      #                                transformations on the data being added
      #                                to the table.
      # <b><tt>:record_class</tt></b>::  Specify the class of the table's
      #                                  records.
      # <b><tt>:eager_loading</tt></b>::  Set to false if you don't want to
      #                                   eager load included associations.
      #
      # The :only, :except, :methods, and :include options may also be passed
      # to the :include option in order to specify the output for any
      # associated models. In this case, the :include option must be a hash,
      # where the keys are the names of the associations and the values
      # are hashes of options.
      #
      # Any options passed to report_table will disable the options set by
      # the acts_as_reportable class method.
      #
      # Example:
      # 
      #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     belongs_to :author
      #     acts_as_reportable
      #   end
      #
      #   Book.report_table(:all, :only => ['title'],
      #     :include => { :author => { :only => 'name' } }).as(:html)
      #
      # Returns:
      #
      # an html version of the table with two columns, title from 
      # the book, and name from the associated author.
      #
      # Example:
      # 
      #   Book.report_table(:all, :include => :author).as(:html)
      #
      # Returns:
      #
      # an html version of the table with all columns from books and authors.

      # Associated object attributes are stored in the record with
      # "association.attribute" keys.
      # 
      # Passing :only as an option will only get those attributes.
      # Passing :except as an option will exclude those attributes.
      # Must pass :include as an option to access associations.  Options
      # may be passed to the included associations by providing the :include
      # option as a hash.
      # Passing :methods as an option will include any methods on the object.

      # Example:
      # 
      #   class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
